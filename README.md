# multiband-slot-patch-antenna
Compact rectangular microstrip patch antenna with four optimized slots for multiband operation. Covers 2.4 GHz ISM, LTE/WiMAX, UWB, radar, and C-band satellite. Simulated in HFSS with S11 &lt; –10 dB and VSWR &lt; 2, achieving wide bandwidth and stable radiation patterns for IoT, wireless, and satellite systems.

📡 Multiband Slot-Loaded Rectangular Patch Antenna

This repository contains the design and simulation files for a rectangular microstrip patch antenna with four optimized slots, developed for multiband wireless and satellite communication applications.

🔹 Overview

The antenna is designed on an FR-4 substrate with a base resonance at 2.4 GHz ISM band (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee). Four slots are introduced into the patch to achieve additional resonances across 3.5 GHz LTE/WiMAX, UWB (3.1–10.6 GHz), 5.5–8 GHz radar/microwave links, and the C-band (5.9–7.5 GHz) for satellite and 5G backhaul.

🔹 Features

✅ Multiband coverage → ISM, LTE/4G, WiMAX, UWB, Radar, Satellite

✅ Compact design → Single rectangular patch with four optimized slots

✅ Enhanced performance → S11 < –10 dB, VSWR < 2, wide bandwidth

✅ Stable radiation → Omnidirectional at ISM, directional at higher bands

✅ Simulation → Designed and analyzed using ANSYS HFSS

🔹 Applications

IoT devices and wireless sensor networks

Wi-Fi & Bluetooth communication

LTE/4G and WiMAX systems

UWB and high-speed wireless data transfer

Radar imaging and defense systems

Satellite communication and 5G backhaul

📊 Results

Return Loss (S11): Multiple resonant dips confirming multiband operation

VSWR: Below 2 across all bands → good impedance matching

Gain: Ranges from ~2.5 dBi to 6 dBi depending on band

Radiation Patterns: Stable, omnidirectional at lower bands, directional at higher bands
